## Development Approach

This project is part of Code Institute's JavaScript Testing With Jest module (CodeInstitute: JT101). While not strictly adhering to Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, it demonstrates a test-driven approach to development. The process may differ from traditional development methods but emphasizes the benefits of building with tests and confirming each piece of code works before moving on to the next.
